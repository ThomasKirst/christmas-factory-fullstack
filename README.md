# christmas-factory-fullstack

This is an example project of a Christmas Web Shop in React and Express. It consists of a client directory holding the React App and a server directory which serves the API.

How to install and run:
1. `git clone REPO`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` to start both client and server in the dev environment
4a. `npm run build` to build the client React app
4b. `npm start` to run the server which serves the client and the API as if it's deployed

In order to persist data in MongoDB, please take a look in the `.env.example` and create an `.env` file locally holding your database credentials

## Happy X-Mas Shopping 🎅🏽.
